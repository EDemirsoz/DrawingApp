# Drawing App

This is a basic drawing app created in Processing, similar to but very limited in comparison with MS Paint. The app allows users to draw rectangles, ellipses, lines, and curves using mouse drag or click. Users can also import and manipulate images, as well as take a screenshot of their canvas.
